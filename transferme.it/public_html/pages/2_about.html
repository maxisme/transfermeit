        <h3>Why is Transfer Me It so secure?</h3>
        <p>
            Each time you send a file, behind the scenes the file is encrypted locally with AES encryption using a locally generated random string.
        <p>
        <p>
            This random string is then encrypted with your friends <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography">public key</a> (generated locally on your friends Mac and stored on our server) before being uploaded to our server along with the encrypted file.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your friend will then receive this now encrypted string, after they have downloaded and then <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2">authenticated</a> the file.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your friend will then be able to decrypt this encrypted string using their <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography">private key</a> and with the decrypted string then decrypt the file.
        </p>

        <h3>Why is Transfer Me It so private?</h3>
        <p>
            <i>We do not take or want any of your files and we couldn't access your files even if we wanted to - thanks to encryption!</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            Files are deleted from our server after the lifetime of your code or immediately after your friend downloads the file.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have also opted for a minimal client side app. Once the download is complete there is no record of the transfer occurring. The same with sending a file.
        </p>
        <p>
            After the transfer has finished all data is removed apart from the sender, when it was sent and how large the file was.
        </p>
        <p>
            All connections between the app and our server are with TLS encryption.
        </p>

            You also don't need to take our word for any of it. Transfer Me It is <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/maxisme/transfermeit">open source</a>!
